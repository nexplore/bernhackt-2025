# Impact Map

This repository contains a prototype for an "Force directed graph", which renders nodes with its connections on a two-dimensional plane.
The nodes incorporate multiple dimensions of data, which are visualized through size, color.
The chosen data-dimensions are based on the framework as described in the requirements of the challenge.
Clicking on a node will activate the attraction forces between its connections.

### Run frontend prototype
- Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- Navigate to `app` directory.
- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
